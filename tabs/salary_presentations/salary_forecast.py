    In this section, we look ahead and try to estimate how inflation â€“ and thus real wages â€“ may develop in the coming years.

    Future versions may include:
    - Forecast models such as Prophet or ARIMA
    - Simulated inflation scenarios
    - Comparison with historical salary trends

    ðŸ“Œ Example: If inflation stays at 4% while salary only rises by 2%, purchasing power is lost.
