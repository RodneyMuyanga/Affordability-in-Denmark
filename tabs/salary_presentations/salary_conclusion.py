    🔍 **Key takeaways:**
    - Salaries have increased nominally, but not always in real terms.
    - Real wages dropped especially in 2022–2023 due to high inflation.
    - Public sector employees and women are among the most affected.

    🧠 **How BI adds value:**
    - Makes complex relations clear and easy to understand.
    - Supports decision-making on salary policy and economic support.
    - Enables real-time monitoring of purchasing power via dashboards.

    🚀 **Looking ahead:**
    - Index SU and benefits to inflation.
    - Base salary negotiations on real wages.
    - Use BI systems to trigger alerts for real income losses.
