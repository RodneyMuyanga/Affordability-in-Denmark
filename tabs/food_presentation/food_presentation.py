    st.markdown("""Food is one of the largest items in any family‚Äôs budget‚Äîand when prices jump, many households must cut back or shift spending. This project explores how annual food-price changes in Denmark over the past decade have affected average household consumption‚Äîand what BI insights can tell us about coping strategies going forward.

**Focus:**  
- **What drives food-price fluctuations?** Key factors like global supply shocks, energy costs, and currency changes.  
- **How has household food consumption evolved?** Trends in spending, quantities bought, and shifts between product categories.  
- **Where do price spikes hurt most?** Identifying the categories (e.g., dairy, oils, produce) with the biggest impact on budgets.  
- **How can BI help?** Using data cleaning, visualization, and basic statistical summaries to reveal actionable insights.""")
