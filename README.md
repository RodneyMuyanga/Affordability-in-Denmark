# 💰 Affordability-in-Denmark

## 📌 Project Introduction

**The Impact of Inflation on Living Costs in Denmark**

Denmark is currently experiencing significant inflation. This project explores how the rising cost of living has impacted daily expenses — including salaries, student grants, food prices, and housing — over the past 10 years.

---

## 📌 Why Affordability and Inflation?

We aim to understand:

- What is inflation, and why does it matter?  
- How do income and key expenses compare over time?  
- How can Business Intelligence provide insights into affordability?

---

## 🎯 BI Problem Definition

### 🧩 Context & Challenge

Inflation has reduced the purchasing power of Danish citizens. While wages and SU have increased, so have essential expenses like food and rent — but not always at the same pace. This imbalance affects affordability and quality of life.

---

### 🎯 Purpose & Research Questions

This project investigates whether incomes in Denmark (2013–2023) have kept up with inflation and how this affects various groups — including students, genders, and sectors.

**Key Questions:**

- Are salaries and SU following the rise in prices?  
- Who is most financially pressured — and why?  
- How do food and housing contribute to economic stress?

---

### 🔧 Expected Solution

Using Business Intelligence tools such as:

- Data visualizations  
- Statistical methods  
- Machine learning  

We uncover how income and expenses have evolved and interacted over time.

---

### 🌍 Positive Impact

Insights from this project can help shape:

- Support schemes  
- Wage negotiations  
- Public policy  

This enables more balanced and equitable economic outcomes.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

A BI project that explores how inflation has affected:

- 📊 Wage development (men, women, and sectors)  
- 🎓 SU recipients' purchasing power  
- 🛒 Food prices and their increase over time  

**Focus Period:** 2013–2023

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

- Have wages and SU kept up with inflation and price increases?  
- Which groups are losing real purchasing power?  
- Are there imbalances between gender, sectors, or population groups?

---

## 🔍 Research Questions

- How has real wage developed in Denmark?  
- Have students lost purchasing power over time?  
- Which food items have increased most in price?

---

## 🧪 Hypotheses

- Wages and SU have not increased at the same rate as inflation and prices  
- Food has become relatively more expensive  
- Women and public sector workers are among the most financially pressured groups
