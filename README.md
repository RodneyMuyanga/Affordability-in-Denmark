# Affordability-in-Denmark

Inflation affects everyone — but not equally.  
This project explores how rising costs impact two groups in Denmark:

- 🎓 Students living on SU
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Families managing household expenses

The goal is to understand and visualize income vs. cost pressures using Streamlit, data wrangling, and BI techniques.
