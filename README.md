# Affordability-in-Denmark
📌 Project Introduction
The Impact of Inflation on Living Costs in Denmark
📌 Why affordability and inflation?
We are currently experiencing a period of significant inflation in Denmark. This project explores how the rising cost of living has affected everyday expenses – including salaries, student grants, food prices, and housing – over the past 10 years.

Focus:

What is inflation, and why does it matter?
How do income and key expenses compare over time?
How can Business Intelligence provide insights into affordability?
🎯 BI Problem Definition
Context & Challenge
Inflation has reduced the purchasing power of Danish citizens. While wages and SU have increased, so have core expenses like food and rent – and not always at the same pace. This growing imbalance affects affordability and quality of life.

Purpose & Research Questions
This project investigates whether incomes in Denmark (2013–2023) have kept up with inflation and how that affects different groups – including students, and gender or sector divisions.

Are salaries and SU following the rise in prices?
Who is most financially pressured – and why?
How do food and housing contribute to economic stress?
Expected Solution
Using Business Intelligence tools such as visualizations, statistical methods, and machine learning, we uncover how income and expenses evolve and interact over time.

Positive Impact
The results offer insights that can help shape future support schemes, wage negotiations, and public policy – enabling more balanced and equitable economic outcomes.

🎯 Project Purpose
A Business Intelligence project that investigates how inflation has affected:

📊 Wage development (men, women, and sectors)
🎓 Student grant (SU) recipients' purchasing power
🛒 Food prices and their increase over time
The project focuses on the period 2013–2023, during which inflation has impacted the financial wellbeing of many Danes.

❓ Problem Statement
Have wages and SU kept up with inflation and price increases?
Which groups are losing real purchasing power?
Are there imbalances between gender, sectors, or population groups?
🔍 Research Questions
How has real wage developed in Denmark?
Have students lost purchasing power over time?
Which food items have increased most in price?
🧪 Hypotheses
Wages and SU have not increased at the same rate as inflation and prices
Food has become relatively more expensive
Women and public sector workers are among the most financially pressured groups
